[Note* 
  The Show Bonsai button shows my own image. You cannot draw while the image is shown, so you have to click the "Return to Drawing" button
  to go back to the drawing canvas.
  There were several additions I added because they were features I wanted for my own art. These include: 
    1. undo button (removes the last shape added)
    2. Triangle manipulation including
      3. Stretch Width
      4. Stretch Height
      6. Ability to flip horizontally 
      7. Flip vertically button
      8. button that allows you to print an equilateral triangle (not right angle)
        - this can be turned off by pressing the equilateral button again.

  Another Note...
  I didn't know whether we were supposed to save all the points for our art piece or just the image itself 
  (because the instructions were a little confusing). I decided to try both. I made one art piece and saved an image of it, 
  then implemented a second 2d canvas that shows the Bonsai tree image when we click "Show Bonsai". This button hides the webgl canvas
  and shows the 2d one (because trying to show a 2d image using the webgl canvas would be a headache). When you click Show Bonsai,
  Both the reference image and my completed image from drawing on the canvas will show up. 
  Return to Drawing to draw again.  

  I also wanted to play around with CSS so that's why my page looks a little different than the professors.

  I also want to credit the art that I was inspired by. Artist: Cienpies
